# Card-Validation-Luhn-Algorithm

#Credit Card Check
This project implements credit card number validation using the Luhn algorithm and identifies their types (VISA, AMEX, MASTERCARD, or INVALID).

**How it Works**
This code utilizes the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers. It then determines the card type based on the initial digits.

**Requirements**
CS50 Library: It utilizes functions from the CS50 library to get user input.

C Compiler: The code is written in C and needs compilation before execution.

**How to Use**
Run the program.
Input the credit card number.
The program will determine its validity and type.
Important
This code performs a basic check for the validity of the card number but does not verify actual ownership or activity of the card.
